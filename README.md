# House price prediction 
## Problem statement

The project uses the [Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) to determine the best properties to buy and re-sell. Specifically, the project aims to identify the characteristics of residential houses that estimate the sale price and the cost-effectiveness of doing renovations.

## Objective
This project aims to implement regression model to predict the house house price based on features. The project consists of 3 part:

1. Predict the house price based on the fixed features.
	- Fixed features mean that these characteristic of the house can not be renovate such as Location, Year of construction
2. Determine the change value of the property characteristics unexplained by the fixed features.
3. Determine the features in the housing data which is the best prediction for "abnormal" sales.
